# Slope by Points
AutoCAD Command: *SLOPEBYPOINTS*

---

The Slope By Points command allows you to select two 3-dimensional points and automatically calculate the slope between. This command is best utilized with **OSnapZ** set to **0**. Once two points are selected, a dialog box will open with prefilled information and calculations at the bottom. This dialog will not close when you enter another command and will update if the *SLOPEBYPOINTS* command is ran again.

## How to Use
In the custom tab, click on **Slope By Points** or enter the command in the command bar. If your OSnapZ is set to 1, you will be prompted if you wish to continue (Note: OSnapZ disables selecting an elevation which will cause all slopes to be 0%). Select your first point and second point. Once the second point is selected, the calculation window will open and automatically calculate 2D distance and slope. You can then either select another two points or edit the northing, easting, or elevation of either point to quickly update the calculations. Only one dialog will ever be present. You can close the window at any time.
